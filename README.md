# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Overview of Project
The goal of this assignment is extract environmental data (such as precipitation and temperatures) from a database and analyze trends across different months

### Results of Employee Retirement Analysis
Below we can see the statistics for the temperatures in the months of June and December:
Temp stats for June       |  Temp stats for Dec

Based on the statistics we can see:
* We have a higher count for the months of June than December even though the Month of December has more days. We probably have more readings for the month of June
* The max temperature is almost the same but the minimum temperature in December is almost 10 degrees less
* The average temperature between the two months only changes by about 4 degrees.

### Summary
Overall we can see that that the temperature fluctuations between June and December are very little.

Additional queries we can use to get additional data:
* Get the count of each of the months by each station to see which one has more data. This is due to point one above where we noted that June had more data points
* Get the counts for the months for each year so we can compare each years June and December to each other
